Functional Extensions for C#

*Note:* I started writing this library, because I was bored.
This is more a proof-of-concept than a serious thing.

This library provides data structures usually used in
functional programming, such as options, cons cells,
computation results etc. It also contains the means to
easily create curried functions and some helpful
exception types.

For more information take a look at the
[wiki](https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/CSX/wiki).
