Functional Extensions for C#

*Note:* I started writing this library, because I was bored.
So I don't guarantee anything. Also, this project uses
some features of C# 7.2, like the private-protected modifier.

This library provides data structures usually used in
functional programming, such as options, cons cells,
computation results etc. It also contains the means to
easily create curried functions.

For more information take a look at the
[wiki](https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/CSX/wiki).
